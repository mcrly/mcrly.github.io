Wow... this was a wild ride. I was so excited for this game since it was first announced. A light hearted Mario Party looking Battle Royale... sweet deal to relax on. I signed up for the beta and had a lot of fun but didn't want to spoil it by playing too much. Then once the trophy list revealed [Infallible](https://psnprofiles.com/trophy/11209-fall-guys-ultimate-knockout/16-infallible) my whole world was turned upside down. 5 wins in a row? Since I figured people would get better as time went on, I basically streamed nightly in order to get it and record my reaction. Needless to say, this singular trophy (and subsequent platinum) has resulted in near World of Warcraft raiding victory dopamine levels. Final results below.
